Submitted by: **Tedman Nguyen**

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## Summary

**PokeFacts** is an android app that **displays a random pokemon from the Indigo League (the first 150 pokemon)**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: ): (: |:

## Application Features

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [X] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [X] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved
- [X] A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [ ] Add a query to the API request
  - The query I added is **FILL IN HERE**
- [ ] Build a UI to allow users to add that query

## API Choice

My chosen API for this project is **PokeAPI**.

## Video Demo

Here's a video / GIF that demos all of the app's implemented features:
